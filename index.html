  </header>

  <section>
    <p>In cities like Mombasa, buildings with raw concrete, sharp edges, and bold, blocky forms tell a deeper story.</p>

    <p>This project explores brutalism — an architectural style born from béton-brut (raw concrete) — which became a symbol of honesty, equality, and rebellion, especially in newly independent African countries like Kenya.</p>

    <p>Post-independence, leaders embraced brutalism to break from colonial architectural traditions and showcase modern African identity. Structures like the KICC in Nairobi, UoN Mombasa campus, and Ambala House stand as monuments to that vision.</p>

    <p>But today, this bold legacy is fading. Glass towers like the KEBS building and TSS Tower are replacing these icons — ironically adopting the very western aesthetics we once rejected. This film questions what we lose when we erase these brutalist landmarks — not just concrete, but character, culture, and a sense of rebellion.</p>

    <p>This short film captures the architectural transformation in Mombasa and questions whether modern high-rise buildings are erasing our identity and history.</p>
